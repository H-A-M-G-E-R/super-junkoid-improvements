; Faster Boot + SPC Engine Echo Improvements
; By H A M
; Makes booting faster by uploading the SPC engine while the Nintendo logo is displayed.
; The echo on a channel when a sound is finished gets re-activated, and the echo never applies to a sound.
; Uses no freespace.
!SPCFreespace = $04BE ; put it in somewhere that mITroid's key off patches never touch
